                                            sensory information such as pressure, touch and pain. A portion of the brain known as the somatosensory cortex
                                            is located in this lobe, which is essential to the processing of body senses. Damage to this lobe can result in 
                                            problems with verbal memory, an impaired ability to control eye gaze and problems with language.</dd>

                                            and information. The primary visual cortex, which receives and interprets information from the rentinas of the 
                                            eyes is located in the occipital lobe. Damage to this lobe can cause visual problems such as color blindles,

                                        <dd>The temporal lobe is located on the bottom section of the brain. The lobe is also the location of the primary
                                            auditory cortex, which is important for interpreting sounds and language we hear. The hippocampus is also 
                                            located in the temporal lobe, which is why this portion of the brain is so heavily associated with the formation
                                            of memories. Damage to this lobe can lead to problems with memory, speech perception, and language skills.</dd>
